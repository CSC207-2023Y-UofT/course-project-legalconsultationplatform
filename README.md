# Legal Consultation Platform+
*Bridging the Gap in Legal Consultation Services*

## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought numerous challenges to the forefront, one of which is an increased need for free legal consultation services across the United States. The uncertainty and economic instability resulting from the pandemic have led to a surge in legal inquiries, which existing resources have been unable to meet effectively. This discrepancy signals a systemic issue that needs immediate attention.

Despite the American Bar Association's (ABA) best efforts, their data reveals a worrying trend. Across the U.S., over 30% of legal questions posed on their platform remain unanswered by attorneys. In certain states like Louisiana, the neglect is even more pronounced with over 70% of inquiries going unanswered. Additionally, among the questions that do receive attention, approximately 35% are inadequately addressed.

Addressing this gap, we introduce the **Legal Consultation Platform+** , a solution tailored to serve both individuals seeking legal advice and registered, licensed attorneys willing to provide it. Our platform is designed to create an environment where individuals can post their legal inquiries free of charge, and attorneys can browse and respond to these questions at their convenience.

One of the standout features of **Legal Consultation Platform+** is its intelligent attorney-question matching system. This system recommends up to five questions from the feed to each attorney, based on their expertise and interests. This not only streamlines the process for attorneys, saving them valuable time, but also enhances the quality of responses. To ensure attorneys do not miss out on relevant inquiries, the platform also sends them email notifications.

Our mission with **Legal Consultation Platform+** is to democratize access to legal consultation and ensure no question goes unanswered or improperly addressed. Together, we can navigate these challenging times by making legal assistance more accessible and efficient for all.

## Client User Guide

### Registration and Account Set-Up

Upon registration, individuals seeking free legal consultation are prompted to set up their accounts and provide demographic information. After registration, clients can log in using their provided user ID and password.

### Interface and Features

The client's homepage presents two main options: initiating a new question or viewing historical queries.

#### Posting a New Question

To post a new question, clients must provide basic information, such as the question title, type, and legal deadline. They can then elaborate on their query in the detailed description section on the specific question page. After submission, clients can track the status of their questions.

#### Tracking Questions

Clients can monitor whether their questions have been answered on the "View Historical Questions" page, which lists all previously asked questions. To enhance visibility, we send an email notification to the client's registered email address once their question has been answered, and we mark the question in the question history page.

#### Closing Questions

Once a client is satisfied with the answer to a question, they can opt to close the question. Closing a question makes it invisible and unresponsive to all attorneys.

#### Rating Experience

Finally, clients can provide binary ratings on their overall experience.

## Future Enhancements

### Web-based Database Management System
In future iterations of our platform, we plan to transition to a web-based database management system. This change will allow for more efficient data management and improved accessibility, making it easier to handle and process data on the platform.

### Intelligent Sample Responses
Another enhancement in our roadmap involves providing intelligent sample responses to clients. This feature will utilize advanced algorithms to identify when a user's query is similar to existing ones. In such instances, the system will automatically suggest sample answers from those previous, similar questions. This will not only speed up the response time for users but also enrich the overall user experience by instantly providing them with helpful information.

We are also in the process of developing a domain-specific Artificial Intelligencesystem. This AI system will be designed to provide timely responses to user queries while we continue to retain the element of real-person answers. This innovative feature will enhance the speed and efficiency of our platform, ensuring that users get the information they need as quickly as possible.
